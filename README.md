# Analysis of Covid-Related Twitter Tweets

This repository will host my individual undergraduate project that involved analysis and generation of insights relating to COVID tweeting activity. Using pandas and natural language processing libraries available in Python, I constructed a full-scale analysis of COVID-19 related twitter tweets from an available twitter API dataset, generating various graphical and verbal insights. The insights involved comparing global tweeting activity throughout different times of the day, analyzing term frequency amongst the tweets and comparing the regional sources of the tweets. This repository contains the jupyter notebook file where the project was created.
